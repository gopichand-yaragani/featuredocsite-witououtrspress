# Overview

The **Configuration Management Database (CMDB)** in Virima serves as a
centralized repository for managing and tracking **Configuration Items
(CIs)**—the essential components of an IT environment. It offers a
structured view of all hardware and software and their
interrelationships, enabling organizations to maintain visibility and
control over their IT infrastructure.

Through the CMDB interface, each CI features a detailed profile that
includes technical attributes, ownership, linked components, audit
history, and lifecycle information. This allows IT teams to trace
dependencies, understand service impacts, and ensure accurate asset
tracking.

By leveraging the CMDB, organizations can achieve:

- **Complete asset visibility** – Unified access to technical and
  business details of every CI.

- **Relationship mapping** – Clear visualization of interdependencies
  among assets.

- **Lifecycle management** – Oversight of changes, maintenance, and
  vulnerabilities over time.

- **Audit and compliance support** – Reliable audit logs and change
  records for governance.

- **Operational efficiency** – Improved incident, problem, and change
  management processes through accurate, up-to-date data.

In essence, Virima’s CMDB lays the foundation for effective IT service
management by ensuring consistent, transparent, and actionable insights
into the IT environment.

# Prerequisites

Before using the CMDB in Virima, ensure the following conditions are
met:

- **CIs must exist in discovered items**

  - A CI must first appear in the *Discovered Items* list before being
    moved into the CMDB.

  - This requires successful **discovery scans** using valid
    credentials.

  - Once discovered, the CI can be formally added to the CMDB.

- **CIs must be present in the CMDB to perform actions**

  - To use CMDB actions such as **Audit, Change Attributes, Process ADM,
    Process Cloud/DevOps Hierarchy, Patch Report, vCenter Hierarchy**,
    and others, the CI must already exist in the CMDB.

  - Actions **cannot be triggered directly** from the *Discovered Items*
    list.

- **Linking ITSM modules to CIs**

  - To associate CIs with ITSM records (e.g., **Incidents, Requests,
    Changes, Problems, Known Errors, Releases, or Knowledge**), manually
    assign the root-cause CI during record creation in the respective
    module.

  - If multiple users need to be assigned for support, go to the **Users
    module** and add the users with the required roles. (Refer to the
    *User Management guide* for detailed instructions on adding users.)

    details.

7.  Updated software installation data is stored in the CMDB.

8.  Review the information in the CI details or relevant CMDB reports.

9.  Monitor progress and completion via the **Sync Logs** page if
    processing runs in the background.

### Process vCenter Hierarchy

The **Process vCenter Hierarchy** action organizes and updates the
hierarchical structure of VMware vCenter resources for selected
Configuration Items (CIs). This process maps virtual machines, hosts,
clusters, data stores, and networks into a structured vCenter hierarchy
within the CMDB.

To run the **Process vCenter Hierarchy** job, ensure that scanned
discovery data is available in the CMDB. Without this data, the vCenter
hierarchy cannot be generated accurately.

1.  Open the **CMDB** module in Virima.

2.  Select the CIs for which you want to identify vCenter resources.

3.  Click the **Select Actions** dropdown at the top-right of the CMDB
    list.

4.  Choose **Process vCenter Hierarchy** from the dropdown.

<img src="C:\Docs\Markdown\media\ITAM_CMDB/media/image33.png"
style="width:4.875in;height:2.375in" />

The system retrieves vCenter resource relationships and structure for
the selected CIs.

5.  It maps them into the correct hierarchy (e.g., data centers →
    clusters → hosts → VMs).

6.  The updated vCenter hierarchy is stored in the CMDB.

7.  Review the structure in the **vCenter Hierarchy** view or relevant
    virtualization dashboards.

8.  Monitor progress and completion via the **Sync Logs** page if
    processing runs in the background.

## Viewing and Editing a CI

Each **Configuration Item (CI)** in the Virima CMDB features a
**dedicated record view** that displays all critical data related to
that CI, organized into tabs. This setup enables users to analyze,
update, and manage the CI from a single screen.

<img src="C:\Docs\Markdown\media\ITAM_CMDB/media/image34.png"
style="width:4.875in;height:2.34167in" />

### CI Left Panel

The left panel provides **quick access details** such as:

- Asset ID & Name

- Blueprint Type

- IP Address, Host Name

- Scan & Modification Timestamps

- Confidence Level

- Warranty, Vendor, and Location Info

This section offers a summary of the CI’s profile for quick validation.

<img src="C:\Docs\Markdown\media\ITAM_CMDB/media/image35.png"
style="width:4.875in;height:1.475in" /><img src="C:\Docs\Markdown\media\ITAM_CMDB/media/image36.png"
style="width:2.83333in;height:6.94167in" />

**How to Update:**

Use one of the following methods:

- Click a **blue hyperlink** (e.g., Windows Host) to open the function
  view.

- Click the **✎ pencil icon** next to a field to edit. Enter the updated
  information and click **Save**.

The availability of editable fields may vary based on the blueprint type
or user permissions.

### Contacts on a CI

Use these cards to record who owns and supports the CI. Each card shows
a profile avatar, **Name**, **Email**, and **Phone**.  
Common controls:

- **Edit** (pencil) — opens a picker to select a user or type details.

- **Remove** (×) — clears the current assignment.

- **Collapse** (–) — hides/shows the card body.

**Validation**

- Email must be a valid format (e.g., name@domain.com).

- Phone must follow standard numbering (digits, +, spaces, dashes).

- When selecting from the directory, only active users can be assigned.

**Owner**

The system assigns the logged-in user as the CI owner when adding or
moving a CI record from Discovered Items to CMDB.

If the discovery process provides a user list and that user exists in
the Admin → User Management directory, Virima assigns that user as the
CI Owner instead of the logged-in user.

After the CI is in the CMDB, you can manually update the Owner field at
any time by editing the CI record.

- **Name** – Owner’s full name (can be chosen from the user directory).

- **Email / Phone** – Auto-filled from the user record; can be edited if
  needed.

- **Remove** – Unassigns the owner; the CI will have no owner until one
  is set.

**First-Level Support *(if enabled in your environment)***

The help desk or primary support group for end-user issues.

- **Name / Email / Phone** – Primary contact for initial triage and
  ticket intake.

- Use **Edit** to assign a person or shared mailbox/account.

**Second Level Support**

The technical team that handles escalations from first level.

- **Name / Email / Phone** – Escalation contact(s) for deeper
  investigation.

- Assign an individual or the lead for a support group.

**Third Level Support**

Specialist/vendor team for complex or product-specific issues.

- **Name / Email / Phone** – Expert contact or vendor support liaison.

- Use for OEM, platform, or engineering escalations.

When a Service Level Agreement (SLA) is triggered for a Configuration
Item (CI) in the Virima CMDB, the system automatically assigns the
First-Level, Second-Level, and Third-Level Support contacts to the CI.
These assignments are based on the support contacts defined in the CI’s
profile

### Manager

The line manager for the CI Owner or support team.

- **Name / Email / Phone** – Used for escalations that require
  managerial action.

- Often auto-suggested when you pick an Owner (pulls org data if
  available).

### How to update a contact (any card)

1.  Click the **pencil** on the card.

2.  In the picker, search and select a user **or** type
    Name/Email/Phone.

3.  Click **Save**. The fields populate and the avatar syncs from the
    user profile.

4.  To clear an assignment, click the **×** on the card.

  completion window.

**Example scenario:**

For an audit named **“detail check”**:

- It will run **daily**.

- It has a **duration of 7 days**.

- The assigned auditor is **Auditor Name**.

- The audit's description is **"check details."**

This setup enables timely verification of asset configurations and
promotes regular CI hygiene practices.

### SLA

To set up response and resolution times for any CI (Incident, Request,
Change, or Problem) whose Root-Cause blueprint’s SLA should apply,
follow these steps:

1.  Open the SLA tab:

    - Click the desired Blueprint.

    - In the Details pane, switch to the SLA tab.

<img src="C:\Docs\Markdown\media\ITAM_CMDB/media/image68.png"
style="width:4.875in;height:2.73333in" />

2.  Set response and resolution targets:

    - Response Time: Enter the maximum time before the first response.

    - Resolution Time: Enter the total time allowed for full resolution.
      *Note*: This value must be at least the sum of your response time
      and any support-level response windows.

3.  Define support-level response windows:

    - In the Support Level fields, specify the response time for each
      tier (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.).

4.  Configure escalation rules:

    1.  **First column**: Choose whether the escalation fires **before**
        or **after** the specified delay.

    2.  **Second column**: Enter the delay amount (hours/minutes) before
        notifications are sent.

    3.  **Third column**: Click **Add** (for a new recipient list) or
        **Update** (to edit an existing one), then select users, roles,
        groups, or departments to alert.

For each rule, specify when it triggers, how long to wait, and who gets
notified:

| **When** | **Delay** | **Notification Recipients** |
|----|----|----|
| *Before/After X* | Time duration (e.g. 30 minutes) | Users, roles, groups or departments (select one or many; use the Add/Update buttons to choose or modify recipients) |

5.  Once all fields and escalation rules are set, click **Save** to
    apply.

### Maintenance

<img src="C:\Docs\Markdown\media\ITAM_CMDB/media/image69.png"
style="width:4.875in;height:2.15833in" />

The **Maintenance** tab allows users to schedule, configure, and manage
maintenance windows for CIs, ensuring operations such as reboot,
shutdown, or patching do not disrupt regular monitoring or trigger false
alarms.

- Click on **New CI Maintenance** to create a new maintenance for the
  CI.

- The system will display the **Add Maintenance** window. Enter the
  required maintenance information, then click **Add** to save the
  maintenance.

<img src="C:\Docs\Markdown\media\ITAM_CMDB/media/image70.png"
style="width:4.875in;height:1.675in" />

**Add Maintenance Window:**

| **Field** | **Description** |
|----|----|
| Name | Name/label for the maintenance window |
| Description | Notes or purpose of the scheduled maintenance |
| Is Active | A checkbox to mark the window as active |
| Start Date | Beginning date of the maintenance window |
| End Date | Ending date (can be left blank if “Never Expire” is selected) |
| Never Expire | If checked, the maintenance continues until manually ended |
| Recurrence | Frequency (e.g., Daily, Weekly) |
| Start Time | Start time for the maintenance of each cycle |
| End Time | End time for the maintenance of each cycle |
| Time Zone | The relevant time zone for the maintenance scheduling |
| Select Client | The client to associate with the maintenance |

**Use case**: Properly configuring maintenance windows ensures that
automated processes, scans, and monitoring systems exclude known
downtime periods, maintaining data accuracy and alert integrity.

### Vulnerability

<img src="C:\Docs\Markdown\media\ITAM_CMDB/media/image71.png"
style="width:4.875in;height:1.54167in" />

The **Vulnerability** tab offers a clear view of known security
weaknesses and risks for a Configuration Item (CI). It helps identify
and prioritize remediation efforts by listing vulnerabilities found
during scans or integrations.

**How to use:**

1.  Navigate to **CMDB** and select a CI.

2.  Click the **Vulnerability** tab.

3.  Review CVEs and filter by severity, ID, or publish/modify date.

4.  If no records appear, the CI may have no known vulnerabilities or
    scanning may be pending.

**Purpose & benefit:**

- Track and manage **security risks** at the CI level.

- Maintain compliance with **vulnerability management policies**.

### Private Properties

The **Private Properties** tab in the Virima CMDB is designed for
storing custom or sensitive asset attributes that may not be covered by
standard fields. These properties are configured at the blueprint level,
allowing organizations to tailor asset records to their unique
requirements.

- Users can edit any private property and click **Save** to modify the
  changes.

### **Tasks**

Lists and manages tasks associated with the CI. Users can create new
tasks, assign ownership, and track progress.

### **Comments**

Provides a space for administrators or users to add notes, updates, or
clarifications related to the CI. This helps in collaboration and
record-keeping.

### **Attachments**

Allows uploading and managing supporting files (e.g., documents,
configuration files, reports, or screenshots) linked to the CI.

### **History**

Displays a detailed audit trail of all changes made to the CI. Each
entry shows the action performed, the date and time of modification, the
user who made the change, and the specific attributes that were updated.

Refer to the [Asset Tab
Details](https://virima.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PM/pages/231112748/Asset+tab+Details)
