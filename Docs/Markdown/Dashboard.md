# Dashboard

# Overview

Dashboards in Virima provide a **centralized, user-friendly interface**
for viewing and managing key system information at a glance. They
consolidate recent activities, scan results, system health, and other
critical metrics into a **visual and customizable layout**, enabling
faster navigation and decision-making.

By offering **real-time visibility** and **interactive data
visualization**, dashboards help IT teams track performance, detect
issues quickly, and collaborate effectively. Whether monitoring assets,
compliance, or scan results, dashboards serve as a **single pane of
glass** for operational oversight.
