# Overview

Virima v6.1 significantly expands AWS cloud infrastructure discovery
capabilities by adding 5 new containerized and serverless compute
services to the existing foundation of 19 previously supported services.
This update focuses on modern cloud-native workloads including container
orchestration, serverless functions, and batch processing.

# **What's New in v6.1**

**Five New Services Added:**

- AWS App Runner - Fully managed containerized web application service

- AWS ECS - Elastic Container Service for containerized applications

- AWS EKS - Elastic Kubernetes Service for Kubernetes workloads

- AWS Lambda - Serverless function computing

- AWS Batch - Batch computing workload management

**Enhanced Relationship Mapping:**

- Complete container orchestration visibility (ECS ↔ EC2, EKS ↔ Node
  Groups)

- Serverless infrastructure dependencies (App Runner ↔ Security Groups)

- Cross-service relationships for comprehensive service mapping

### **Import Scheduling Best Practices**

**Service-Specific Frequencies**

| Service    | Production | Development | Reasoning                             |
|------------|------------|-------------|---------------------------------------|
| App Runner | 4-6 hours  | Daily       | Deployment-driven changes             |
| ECS        | 2-4 hours  | 6-8 hours   | Highly dynamic container tasks        |
| EKS        | 4-6 hours  | Daily       | Kubernetes clusters relatively stable |
| Lambda     | 6-8 hours  | Daily       | Function configs change infrequently  |
| Batch      | 8-12 hours | Daily       | Compute environments are static       |

**Orchestration Strategy**

- Staggered Imports: Different services at different times

- Dependency Order: Import clusters before services/tasks

- Error Isolation: Service failures don't affect other imports
