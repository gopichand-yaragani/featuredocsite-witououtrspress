# Overview

The **Relationship Types** feature in Virima defines how Configuration
Items (CIs) connect and interact within the SACM module. By
standardizing relationship labels and their visual representation, it
allows organizations to accurately model dependencies, associations, and
service interactions across infrastructure, applications, and services.

Each relationship type includes both a **primary** and **reverse name**,
ensuring clarity in how connections are displayed and interpreted. This
functionality enhances **topology visualization**, improves **impact
analysis**, and supports ITIL processes such as change management and
configuration audits.

# Relationship Types
