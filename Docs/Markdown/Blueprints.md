# Overview

Blueprints in Virima provide a structured and reusable framework for
modeling IT assets and their relationships within the Configuration
Management Database (CMDB). Acting as templates, blueprints define the
key attributes, properties, and interdependencies of different
Configuration Items (CIs) such as servers, applications, network
devices, or databases.

They ensure consistency and accuracy in CI representation by
standardizing asset fields, enforcing integrity checks, and managing
metadata. Blueprints also enable organizations to map relationships
across infrastructure components, apply governance policies, and
maintain a uniform approach to asset modeling.

By leveraging blueprints, IT teams can automate asset onboarding,
streamline CI classification, and enhance the overall quality of CMDB
data—supporting better decision-making, operational efficiency, and
service management.

### **Configure SLA (If Applicable)**

Use these steps to set up response and resolution times for any CI
(Incident, Request, Change or Problem) whose Root‑Cause blueprint’s SLA
should apply.

- Open the blueprint and switch to the **SLA** tab.

<img src="C:\Docs\Markdown\media\Blueprints/media/image18.png"
style="width:4.875in;height:2.46667in" />

- Set response and resolution targets for incidents, requests, changes,
  or problems related to this CI type.

  - **Response Time**: Enter the maximum elapsed time before a first
    response must occur.

  - **Resolution Time**: Enter the total time allowed for full
    resolution. *Note*: this value must be at least as large as the sum
    of your response time plus any support‑level response windows.

  - In the **Support Level** fields, specify how long each tier (1st,
    2nd, 3rd, etc.) has to respond.

- Define escalation rules, support level response windows, and
  notification recipients.

  - For each rule, you’ll specify when it fires, how long to wait, and
    who gets notified:

    - **First column**: Choose whether the escalation action fires
      **Before** or **After** the specified delay.

    - **Second column**: Enter the delay amount (hours/minutes) before
      notifications go out.

    - **Third column**: Click **Add** (for a new recipient list) or
      **Update** (to edit an existing one), then pick users, roles,
      groups or departments who should be alerted.

### SLA Escalation Rule Columns

| **When** | **Delay** | **Notification Recipients** |
|----|----|----|
| Before/After  | Time duration (e.g. 30 min) | Users, roles, groups, or departments (select one or many; use Add/Update to modify list) |

- Save your SLA configuration to activate it for the blueprint.
